# Requirement Specification

## Purpose of the application

The application is a memory game, where the user has to find matching pictures by turning them over. The game features pictures of cats.
 

## Functionality

- the user can choose the size of the grid layout of the game (small, medium, large)
- the user can determine the difficulty (i.e. same color cats vs. cats in multiple colors)
- the user can play with or without a timer
- the user can restart the game

## Ideas for future development
- obstructed cards, which can't be flipped until a condition is met (e.g. enough cards have been turned over)
- special cards that, when flipped, give the player a boost, such as temporarily stopping the timer or quickly showing all of the cards on the grid
