# Requirement Specification

## Purpose of the application

The application is a memory game, where the user has to find matching pictures by turning them over. The game features pictures of cats.

## Functionality

- the user can enter the game from the menu screen
- the user can see the locally saved high scores
- the user can restart the game

## Ideas for future development
- obstructed cards, which can't be flipped until a condition is met (e.g. enough cards have been turned over)
- special cards that, when flipped, give the player a boost, such as temporarily stopping the timer or quickly showing all of the cards on the grid
