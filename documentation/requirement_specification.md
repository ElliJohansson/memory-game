# Requirement Specification

## Purpose of the application

The application is a memory game, where the user has to find matching pictures by turning them over. The game features pictures of cats.

## Functionality

- the user can enter the game or the scores from the menu screen
- the timer in the game screen saves the user's score (lower time equals higher score)
- the user can see the locally saved high scores
- the user can restart the game in the middle of an ongoing game (the user's score won't be saved if an ongoing game is restarted), or after completion

## Ideas for future development
- obstructed cards, which can't be flipped until a condition is met (e.g. enough cards have been turned over)
- special cards that, when flipped, give the player a boost, such as temporarily stopping the timer or quickly showing all of the cards on the grid
